We war back-to-back. We always try to include as many members as possible. But due to team size limits we sometimes have to drop or add people as needed. 

If you haven't been to war with us before, please post your war base in the game chat and then be sure to check that your war availability is checked in the alliance gate window. If your war box isn't checked, you will not be included in the war. 

We have no rules as to whom you attack. We only ask that you do your best and go after a target that you believe you can get 5 stars on. 

We also recommend that you go to war with as many coalitions and troop tactics as you can afford. We all strive to win and this is really needed nowadays as most alliances are using them. 

As for Stronghold Troops, they are not required but are always appreciated! We often use SH troops in close battles and to help round out our defense. If you have extra troop cards, please feel free to donate wherever you see fit. 

Always use both of your attacks. Wars can be won or lost by very close margins and you never know when that second attack will make the difference. Also, all of our members work hard to bring coalitions and donate troops. Because of this, it can be insulting if you don't bother to use your attacks. Besides, you should want the 2nd attack so that you get a better victory chest. 

Lastly, we are all here to have fun. Please have fun and don't take anything too seriously.
